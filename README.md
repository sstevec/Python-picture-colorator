Change the color on picture

How to use this colorator

[Select Picture]: Click to select a [PNG or JPG] file from your device

[Save Picture]: Save the picture to a location, with a given name. The original picture would not be changed!!!

[Select Color]: You need to load the picture first, then click this button and click somewhere on the picture. 
                This would allow the program collect the color you would like to change from the picture.
                
[Change To]: Click this button to open up a color panel, you can choose the target color from this panel.

[Render Range]: You need to input a number here with range 1 - 195075, the larger this number is, the more color it would change.
                For example, you want to change the white color into black, if you have a large render range, the program would also
                change those color close to white into black like light grey, if you have just 1, then this program would strictly restrict to
                just white color.
                
[Do Change]: You need to select color from picture, select target color and enter a vaild number into render range first.
             Then Click this button to do the change on the picture, the original picture would not change!!!
             
[Undo]: Just like anyother undo button, this would go back one step
